# PIGEanalysis

Usage

Program starts at batchGSpec function. Input is a folder containing spectra of interest. 
An appropriate spectrum file reader function should be provided. We currently have readchn for the binary format.
One for .spe files is being developed.

Peaks of interest are specified. NOTE: In upcoming versions, we may completely ignore the conversion from channel to energy and work with
just the channel numbers after we've identified which correspond to 109, 197, 660 keV.
