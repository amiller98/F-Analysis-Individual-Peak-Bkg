# PIGEanalysis

**Usage**

Program starts at batchGSpec function. Input is a folder containing spectra of interest. 
An appropriate spectrum file reader function is provided. .SPE or .CHN files may be used.

Current set up outputs summary file with argon-normalized fluorine counts per uC + error along with diagnostic argon information.

In Progress: Currently ensuring that files are properly associated with their extrapolated current values during the normalization process.

Branches: A chlorine-specific analysis is currently being developed as a branch. A voigt-fitting procedure is a potential branch.
